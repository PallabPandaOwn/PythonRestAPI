# In Python, 
Classes are blueprints for creating objects. They define the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will share. Here's a breakdown of classes and how to use them with an example:

- Concepts:

Class: A blueprint that defines the structure of objects. It specifies the attributes (variables) that objects will have and the methods (functions) that objects can perform.
Object: An instance of a class. It represents a specific entity with its own set of attributes and methods defined by the class.

- Benefits of Classes:

Code Reusability: Classes allow you to define the structure and behavior of objects once and then create multiple objects (instances) with the same characteristics, reducing code duplication.
Data Encapsulation: You can control access to object attributes and methods by defining them as private, public, or protected within the class.
Object-Oriented Programming: Classes are fundamental building blocks of object-oriented programming (OOP), a powerful paradigm for structuring complex applications.
